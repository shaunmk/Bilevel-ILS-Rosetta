#Do not modify this file and check it in.
#First copy this file to pilot_apps.src.settings.my, then modify it to include the
#sources of the pilot applications you want built.
#Remember also to setup the devel.src.settings.my file to include any experimental
#files that your pilot application needs.

# Helpful hint:
#  When using cmake/make_project.py, the .settings.my file will override the usual .settings
#  file as the list of .cc files to compile.  It will not be checked into git (it is listed in .gitignore).
#  When ready for primetime, move your apps into this .settings file.
